Just for fun. Powershell talking script. 

I created this a long time ago as I was learning to write powershell.

Run it as a logon script, or a random scheduled task. It'll pull from a list of phrases or some random things I added, just to make things extra annoying, it unmutes the speaker and sets the volume to max.
